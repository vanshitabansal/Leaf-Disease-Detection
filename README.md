Grapes, grown in a subtropical climate, are considered one of the most important commercial crops grown in Indian agriculture. It has been considered as one of the lucrative farming activities in India. Grape cultivation in India is affected by several insect pests and diseases that lead to about 40% downfall in economical crop production and degrade crop quality. To detect the diseases at the initial stage is utterly important for diagnosis else it can inadequately affect the plant and reduce the production rate. The foremost objective of our system is to detect the diseases at the initial stage of crop cultivation. In our system, we have proposed a Deep Learning model named Convolutional Neural Network to detect the diseases affected areas of our leaf. The system involves the following steps like image acquisition, pre-processing, image segmentation, and feature extraction.
